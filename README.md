Introduction about Cache:

Cache is a copy of a subset of main memory that stores the recently visited data. Cache
memory (SRAM) is used to speed up the application performance and increase its efficiency as
it is faster than main memory (DRAM), consumes less access time as compared to main
memory and It stores the program that can be executed within a short period of time. There are
three types of cache. First is direct mapped cache which has each block mapped to exactly one
cache memory location, then Fully associative cache mapping, it is similar to direct mapping in
structure but allows a memory block to be mapped to any cache location and Set associative
cache mapping which can be viewed as a compromise between both direct mapping and fully
associative mapping in which each block is mapped to a subset of cache locations.
